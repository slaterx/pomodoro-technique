# Definition

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any task. The methodology is simple: When faced with any large task or series of tasks, break the work down into short, timed intervals (called "Pomodoros") that are spaced out by short breaks.


--

Francesco Cirillo crafted the Pomodoro Technique in 1992, as a personal system to get more studying done. Cirillo named the system "Pomodoro" after the tomato-shaped timer he used to track his work as a university student.

--


The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work.

# Breakdown

.right[![Pomodoro clock](images/pomodoro_clock.png "Pomodoro clock")]
.left[Here's how to do it:]

--
- Choose a task to be accomplished

--

- Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)


--

- Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper


--

- Take a short break


--

- Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break

---

# Breakdown

The "short break" can be up to 5 minutes. That "longer break" is usually on the order of 15-30 minutes, whatever it takes to make you feel recharged and ready to start another 25-minute work session.

--

Repeat that process a few times over the course of a work day, and you actually get a lot accomplished -- and took plenty of breaks to grab a cup of coffee or refill your water bottle.


--

It's important to note that a pomodoro is an indivisible unit of work -- that means if you're distracted part-way by a coworker, meeting or emergency, you either have to end the pomodoro there (saving your work and starting a new one later), or you have to postpone the distraction until the pomodoro is complete.


---

# Breakdown

To negotiate and postpone distractions, Cirillo suggests the "inform, negotiate and call back" strategy:

--

1. Inform the other (distracting) party that you're working on something right now.

--

2. Negotiate a time when you can get back to them about the distracting issue in a timely manner.

--

3. Schedule that follow-up immediately.

--

4. Call back the other party when your pomodoro is complete and you're ready to tackle their issue.


???
Of course, not every distraction is that simple, and some things demand immediate attention. Sometimes, it's perfectly fine to tell your coworker "I'm in the middle of something right now, but can I get back to you in.... 10 minutes?" Doing so doesn't just keep you in the groove, it also gives you control over your workday.

---

# Breakdown

Since the Pomodoro Technique focuses squarely on *how you **do** your work* and not on *how you **organise** your work*, you can mix with other methods and systems, such as:

--

- Scrum

--

- Kanban

--

- GTD

--

- Kaizen

---

# Breakdown

The Pomodoro Technique is often championed by developers, designers and other people who have to turn out regular packages of creative work.

--

That means everyone from authors writing their next book to software engineers working on the next big video game can all benefit from the timed work sessions and breaks that Pomodoro offers.

--

However, it's also useful for people who don't have such rigid goals or packages of work. Anyone else with an "inbox" or queue they have to work through can benefit as well. The system is remarkably adaptable to different kinds of work.

--

Finally, it's important to remember that Pomodoro is a productivity system -- not a set of shackles. The goal is to help you get into the zone and focus -- but it's also to remind you to come up for air. Regular breaks are important for your productivity.

--

Also, keep in mind that Pomodoro is just one method, and it *may or may not* work for you. It's flexible, but don't try to shoehorn your work into it if it doesn't fit. Productivity isn't everything -- it's a means to an end, and a way to spend less time on what you have to do so you can put time to the things you want to do.

???

If you're a system's engineer with tickets to work, you can set a timer and start working through them until your timer goes off. Then it's time for a break, after which you come back and pick up where you left off or start a new batch of tickets. If you build things or work with your hands, the frequent breaks give you the opportunity to step back and review what you're doing, think about your next steps and make sure you don't get exhausted.

If you're making headway and the timer goes off, it's OK to pause the timer, finish what you're doing, and then take a break.

If this method helps, go for it. If not, don't force it.
